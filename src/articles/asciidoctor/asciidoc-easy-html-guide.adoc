There are plenty of static site generators.
They are getting very popular in the techy world and most of them are using Markdown (simple rules to format text files).
Even when taken into account how easy those are, it involves a certain workflow to setup and maintain.
On the other hand there is a variety of simple markup languages that can do the most common tasks and range from BBcode to Org-mode.
It seems difficult to strike correct balance of usability, features and remain human readable.
The consistency of formatting is therefore very important.
One such text markup type stands out as being superior and also easy to use.
This is of course Asciidoc!
Originally developed in Python, it has been rediscovered by Ruby community and gained a lot of traction in its Asciidoctor reimplementation.

Asciidoc is awesome!
Once you used Markdown for something other than blogging it is remarkable how limiting it can be.
The natural thought then to use static site generator to get some sort of structure in the documents.
But site generators often introduce their own markup, making the whole process cumbersome.
The problem is, when people hear about Asciidoc or even Markdown they suddenly imagine the markup language to be as hard as programming.
In real life it is not more difficult to use than Word, it is just the question of familiarity.
No one forces you to use all the features in Word, so the same applies for Asciidoc.
The name is a bit silly, your final text doesn't have to be in ascii!
Actually I think the name Asciidoc somehow sounds too technical and might scare away people who could benefit from the format the most.
I'm talking about various documentation writers and administrators that use MS Office on the daily basis.
If Asciidoc file format - *.adoc*  would be marketed as such, the public perception would find it natural replacement for *.doc* and *.docx* files of the world.


== So, MS Word is not good enough?!

If you're writing text documents, the emphasis should be on text.
Most people use Word because it's feature rich and allows fancy styling.
But the format that it uses is binary, meaning it can not be opened and edited in plain text form.
You need special software, this is not trivial, imagine that in a few years Word starts to interpet your files differently.
The solution can be costly and time consuming.
If you need to apply machine readable formatting you will have to reinvent the wheel.

:git: http://www.git-scm.com/[Git]

In Asciidoc, you are writing plain text, that means one could use version control system like {Git}.
The implication of this is huge.
Not only will you be able to find out how your writing has progressed but also specifically go back in time and see the exact changes that were made.


Another big advantage of writing in Asciidoc it is very easy to comment out lines (meaning- hide) with whole sentences just by adding // at the start of the line.
Alternatively comment out whole paragraphs by placing four slashed lines, at the beginning and the end, like this:

....
////
I commented-out
this text with four slashes.

And the result is that
this whole chunk of text gets hidden!
/////
....

Word documents are one of the worst formats for writing collaborative text.
When it tracks changes it does so in the way that it can't be decoupled from the file.
If you writing, say a scientific paper, chances are that you would be better of by splitting your document in appropriate chunks and putting those in different files.
By doing this you can get rid of mental burden and concentrate on the part that you write for the moment.
With Git you still get the tracking on changes on all of your *.adoc* files in the folder.
By using *include directive* you can still combine the parts of your document in the output at any time (you get one file in combined html, pdf etc).

#_include::included_file.adoc[]_#

If one for some reason wishes to include only part of the file, you can specify the line range:

#_include::included_file.adoc[lines=7..-1]_#

In this case it is from line 7 to the end of the document.
In programming terms -1 here represents the last line, this is practical: think if we would start counting from the end without knowing the total number of lines.
Just don't use other negative numbers!

Line numbering quickly becomes obsolete if you change text in *included_file.adoc* so you could put *tag=mymethod* in those square brackets instead of *lines=7..-1*.
Where my method is the name of the tag that you choose to describe this specific part of the text.
In order for this to be included you need to add comments around the part that you wish to include, like this:
....
// tag::mymethod[]
Here I decribe my new method description
bla bla bla
// end::mymethod[]
....

Now, by doing this - even if it is moved to other part of the included document it will still be added to the final output.
It is especially useful when you write code documentation (search on asciidoctor webpage for how to include code snippets).

What if I describe my new method then write something else and then continue to describe my methods?
One could simply add another chunk and it will also be included.
....
// tag::mymethod[]

Here I continue to decribe my new method and it gets included.
Isn't it nice?!

// end::mymethod[]
....


The biggest obstacle in Word is that its "tracking changes" comes so much in the way of editing that you have to turn it off because after awhile it just becomes unbearable.



== Asciidoctor to the rescue, Asciidoc is the best thing since sliced bread!

So why is it better to use Asciidoc?
Markdown has a lot of pitfalls: it mixes html tags and its own formatting in a way that it becomes difficult to use.
For example comments in Markdown:
....
<!-- comments here... -->
....

This requires to press different keys, the result it that it just takes to much effort to jot down your thoughts in the middle of the text using Markdown.
Asciidoc on the other hand makes writing fun again!
Atom editor has one main package called *Asciidoc-preview*.
It's all that requires, install Atom and add this package.
When you installed Atom, you will se the window called _Welcome Guide_ (if you are not presented with Welcome Guide, open it from the Help menu).
From there, click *Install a Package* and then *Open Installer*

image::{img}/atom_welcome.png[]
image::{img}/install_asciidoc.png[]

Write Asciidoc-preview and click packages and you would be presented with one by Asciidoctor.
Click install. If you wish to have nicer highlighting of the markup you could also add *Language-asciidoc* package.
It makes it easier to see when you add special attributes and things like that.

image::{img}/language_asciidoc.png[]

It is important to note that Asciidoc text works just as nicely without syntax highlighting, as well as in other text editors besides Atom.
The *Asciidoc-preview* package can be activated by pressing *Ctrl Shift A* on the keyboard or by clicking in the packages menu.

More info on https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-preview

// == Attributes are one of the biggest features in Asciidoc

== Writing, from the ground up

When you write something, the text should be in focus of your attention.
Abstracting it away in meaningless formatting before it's finished is pointless.
I always saw the formatting of unfinished text like putting a lipstick on the pig.
It should instead be: when you prepared the ham (text), be sure to serve it nicely.
One of the best tips for writing that I heard comes from one of the Asciidoctor guys:
if you write the document in markup like Asciidoc, write each sentence on separate line.
That forces you to have short clear meanings and becomes much easier to read.
For this to work something like Asciidoc is essential.
That's because in order to break text into new paragraph you need to leave one empty line.
So the result would be nice fluent text, but when you work on it you can still clearly se where the sentence begins.

== Using _Atom editor_ and _Asciidoc-preview_ to generate viable html files
:atom: https://atom.io[Atom editor]

{atom} is a nice modern text editor, it allows the use of most common shortcuts and is very customizable.
Start writing
....
= This is the title!
documents description: bla bla bla

Text text text
etc

== Subsection title

text text text
etc
....

The syntax is extremely simple and takes just a couple of minutes to get going:
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

When *Asciidoc-preview* is activated (Ctrl A), you can right-click on the generated html and save it.
The generated html is for embedded style. To get the [blue]#_Table of Context_# (TOC) in your html -
just add [blue]#*:toc: macro*# under the main title and then [blue]#*toc::[]*# in the place where you want your TOC to be.
Like http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#manual-placement[this].

That all works good and all, but what if you want to publish many html pages?
The default saves the style inside the html file, that means it would need a lot of bandwidth to download for your website visitors.
Luckily this is solvable by opening the Atom installation folder and changing the default html template.
On Windows it in hidden folder (change settings to show hidden folders first)
probably located in *C:\Users\Your_username\.Atom\packages\asciidoc-preview\templates*

If you change default.html to use CSS file (it styles html) instead of inbedded styling you can greatly reduce server load times.
To do this, remove everything between the style tags: *<style>...</style>* including the style tags themselves and link it to your own CSS style by adding this line: #*<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">*#
This last expression means that it would be located in css folder relative to your html file.
So if my index.html is in *my_folder* the css file would be in *my_folder/css/*

Also if you include your own css file you will not need to add *:toc: macro* under the main title and then *toc::[]* in each document!
So how to create this css file? The style between <style>...</style> tags is in *less* format so you can use any tool to port it back to css.
You can also just copy the https://usermail.github.io/css/style.css[css file of this page].

Here is how to create tables:
....
.My table
[]
|===
| Column title A | Column title B | Column title C

| item A1        | item B1        | item C1

| item A2        | item B2        | item C2

| item A1        | item B3        | item C3
|===
....
It results in this:

.My table
[]
|===
| Column title A | Column title B | Column title C

| item A1        | item B1        | item C1

| item A2        | item B2        | item C2

| item A3        | item B3        | item C3
|===

It's quite simple really and self explanatory. Square brackets are optional, you can put special parameters there.
